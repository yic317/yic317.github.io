### The mysterious time of creation[^1]

> the exact timeframe for the creation of Illuminations remains a topic of debate in academic circles[^2]. Some researchers believe it should be between 1872 and 1873, which corresponds to Rimbaud's “seer phase.” Proponents of this view also argue that Illuminations was written before A Season in Hell, which was composed between April and August 1873. On July 10, 1873, the infamous Brussels incident occurred, during which Paul Verlaine, in a drunken state, shot at Rimbaud twice, causing him minor injuries. Following this, Rimbaud returned to his hometown of Charleville and quickly completed A Season in Hell (Une Saison en Enfer), originally intended to be titled The Pagan Book (Livre Païen) or The Black Book (Livre Nègre).

> According to Verlaine, the composition of Illuminations should have taken place between 1873 and 1875, during Rimbaud's wanderings in Belgium, England, and Germany (see, for example, André Guyaux, Poétique du fragment: Essai sur les "Illuminations" de Rimbaud, pp. 13–74). This period also coincided with the two years Verlaine spent in prison. In late February 1875, after his release from prison, Verlaine met his friend in Stuttgart, where Rimbaud may have handed over the manuscript of Illuminations to him.

> Some researchers, however, believe that the writing of Illuminations may have occurred even later.

### Meaning of the title[^3]
> The title Illuminations also poses a mystery for researchers.

> In French, “illuminations” means “illumination” or “enlightenment,” and in a religious sense, it carries connotations of “revelation” or “inspiration.” It can be understood as “insight” or “epiphany.” Therefore, this collection of prose poems is often considered by researchers as works written under Rimbaud's “divine inspiration,” aligning with his poetic style as a “seer poet.”

> However, in the preface to the first publication of Illuminations in the Symbolist poetry magazine La Vogue in 1886, Verlaine stated that “Illuminations” is an English word meaning “coloured plates.” He also added that this was a subtitle that Rimbaud himself wrote on his manuscript.

***Illuminations: After the Flood***[^4]
> Rimbaud might even have intended his poems to appear in a particular order. “Après le déluge (After the flood)”, which came first in the original edition, does form the perfect sequel to the theological angst of Une Saison en Enfer: “As soon as the idea of the Flood had subsided . . .” But this is pure speculation. It is not even certain that the forty-one poems are the complete work. Several sticky hands sifted through this “dodgy pack of cards” before it finally appeared, without Rimbaud’s knowledge, in 1886.
